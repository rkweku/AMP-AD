This is an incomplete code which functions to identify a variety of patient samples within a Synapse project and organize them into one table with them into one table with the patient ID being a primary key. Only functions properly with the ROSMAP data for now. Takes clinical data and merges that with the key file, then it identifies the Synapse ID of various data files if it exists for that patient.
